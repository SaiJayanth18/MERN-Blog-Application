The Backend Project centers on the creation of a Blog Application, a powerful platform that enables users to engage in content creation, management, and retrieval. The application encompasses essential features such as user authentication, post manipulation, and search capabilities. The user can login to the system if he/she already has an account. Otherwise, you have to fill the registration form first, and then login into the system. This system is simple and functional for the login and registration process. Talking about the features of the system, it contains only the user section. From here, the user can login into the system. The design of this project is adequate so that the user won’t find any difficulties while working on it. The blog is a platform for users to post their opinions and react upon them through a friendly environment. The Blog Database stores the credentials of the users along with the created posts and comments on them. Creation and retrieval of these details are possible through JWT Authentication. Searching option is available for posts and bookmark indicator.
